intro = """
Two identical doors block your path. Each bears the same lock.
A single iron key hangs on the wall between them.

The inscription reads: "Both must open. The key is consumed by each."

You'll need more than one key. But there's only one on the wall...
"""

success = """
You duplicate the key, its iron form shimmering as a perfect copy
materializes. Both doors accept their keys and swing open in unison.

> WORDS OF WISDOM: When you truly need a value in two places,
> clone() creates a copy. It costs memory and time, but sometimes
> it's the only way. Don't clone reflexively—ask first if you can
> borrow instead. But when you need two owners, clone is your friend.

The twin passages merge into one. Level complete!
